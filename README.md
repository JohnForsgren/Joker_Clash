# Joker_Clash
Joker Clash is currently my largest project in Unity. Released on Android and iOS. It has been a very educating experience as I have designed the entire game myself with minimal use of existing libraries and methods.

This repository showcases largest and most significant classes of the game. The entire game includes a total of 20 classes, with about 5000 lines of code in total. 

A demo showing the gameplay can be found here:
